# Notes

* There is few information on tickets dataset that can relate to training/test data

## Strategy
- Total number of subscriptions by account
- Total number of individual tickets by account
- Find correlation between categorical and numerical price.level
- Multiple subscriptions only 73 yes against thousands of no (probably not worth using it)
